The computational analysis was done in R using primarily Monocle3 and dependency packages. The sections of code used to create specific figure panels are designated in the comments of the file.

Figure 3.R contains code associated with Figure 3 for analysis of freshly sorted FL HSC data.

Figure 4.R contains code associated with Figure 4 for analysis of FL HSC co-cultured on stroma.

Figure 7-Nichnetr.R contains code associated with Figure 7 for analysis done with NicheNetR.

Figure 7-ReceptorLigand-pairs.R contains code associated with Figure 7 for analysis to identify novel receptor ligand interactions.
